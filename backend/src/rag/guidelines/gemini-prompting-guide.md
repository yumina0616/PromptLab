## Best practices for prompts

### 1. Use natural language
Talk to Gemini as if you were speaking to a friend or colleague.

- Instead of: “Training plan.”
- Try: “Write a training plan for the sales team for the launch of a brand new product.”

### 2. Be clear and concise
Gemini can follow precise instructions, so avoid ambiguity.

- Instead of: “Marketing talking points.”
- Try: “Give me 12 thoughtful questions to ask a Chief Marketing Officer on their strategy for 2024.”

### 3. Provide context
More context produces better, more useful responses.

- Instead of: “Write about a sales job.”
- Try: “Write a job description for a [job title], including the required skills and experience, as well as a summary of [company name] and the position.”

### 4. Use specific and relevant keywords
Specific keywords help Gemini understand the task accurately.

- Instead of: “Create project plan.”
- Try: “Create a project plan for the launch of a brand new product. The timeframe should be from now until June 2024.”

### 5. Break down complex tasks
For multi-step tasks, split them into separate prompts. This helps Gemini understand each request and provide better responses.

Example: When recruiting and hiring for a job opening, use separate prompts for crafting job descriptions, interview questions, evaluation rubrics, etc.
